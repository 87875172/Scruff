# scruff: Single Cell RNA-Seq UMI Filtering Facilitator

[**scruff**](https://doi.org/10.1101/522037) (**S**ingle **C**ell **R**NA-Seq **U**MI **F**iltering **F**acilitator) is a package for processing single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) FASTQ reads generated by CEL-Seq and CEL-Seq2 protocols. It demultiplexes scRNA-seq FASTQ files, aligns reads to reference genome using [Rsubread](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz114), and generates UMI filtered count matrix.
